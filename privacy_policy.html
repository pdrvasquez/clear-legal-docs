    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Clear ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use the Clear mobile application.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p><strong>We do not collect, transmit, or store any of your personal data on external servers.</strong></p>

        <li>Usage preferences and settings</li>
    </ul>
    <p>...is stored exclusively on your device using local storage mechanisms provided by your operating system.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>Your data is stored locally on your device using:</p>

    <p>Clear does not integrate with any third-party analytics, tracking, or advertising services. We do not use cookies, trackers, or any data collection mechanisms.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, the security of your data depends on:</p>

        <li>Your device's operating system security</li>
